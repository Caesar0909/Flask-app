<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>
    To supplement the API, data for each device is saved in csv format on a daily
     basis. Each file contains the data for one device and can be downloaded one
     at a time (pink download button on the right hand side), or in bulk by
     selecting multiple files via the checkbox on the left hand side and then
     clicking the 'download selected data' button.
